			<p>A foil is one of the three weapons used in the sport of fencing, all of which are metal. It is flexible, rectangular in cross section, and weighs under a pound. As with the épée, points are only scored by contact with the tip, which, in electrically scored tournaments, is capped with a spring-loaded button to signal a touch. A foil fencer's uniform features the lamé (a vest, electrically wired to record hits in such cases), a jacket (made of thick cloth covering the groin area, chest and arms), a glove, so called knickers, long socks (to prevent damage to shins by foils), shoes (generally light and with beveled edges), an 'under-arm protector' (thick cloth sleeve-like thing worn under the jacket), a mask (strong grated metal with cloth 'bib'), for women and young children, a chest protector (a strong stiff plastic plate protecting the upper chest area), and the foil. It is the most commonly used weapon in competition.</p>

			<div class="sGrid2">
				<div> <p>In foil the valid target area includes the torso (including the lower part of the bib of the mask) and the groin. (Areas hilighted in red) The head (except the lower part of the bib of the mask), arms, and legs are considered off target. Touches made off target do not count for points, but do stop play. The target area has been changed multiple times, with the latest change consisting of adding the bottom half of the bib to the target zone.</p></div>
