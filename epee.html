				While modern sport fencing has three weapons: foil, épée, and sabre, each a separate event, épée is the only one in which the entire body is the valid target area (the others restricting to varying areas above the waist). Épée is the heaviest of the three modern fencing weapons. As with all fencing disciplines, fencing matches with the épée require a large amount of concentration, accuracy and speed. Since the entire body is a target, a successful épée fencer must be able to anticipate their opponent's moves and strike their opponent at the correct time.

				<div> <p>In most higher-level competitions a grounded metal piste is used to prevent floor hits from registering as touches. Unlike sabre and foil, in épée there are no right-of-way rules regarding attacks, other than the aforementioned rule regarding touches with only the point of the weapon. Touches are awarded solely on the basis of which fencer makes a touch first, according to the electronic scoring machines. Also, double-touches are allowed in épée, although the touches must occur within 40 milliseconds (1/25 of a second) of each other.</p></div>
